<!-- /retcomm-readme-metrics -->

Static recompilation of **Wild Arms** built on
[psxrecomp](https://github.com/mstan/psxrecomp) and
[recomp-ui](https://github.com/RetroPortingToolKit/recomp-ui).

This is an owned-input setup kit. You supply your own SCUS-94608 disc image
and your own SCPH-1001 (USA) BIOS dump; first-run setup generates and compiles the game on
your machine. The kit and its release archives contain no game disc, retail BIOS,
generated game code, or saved game.

| | |
|---|---|
| Region | USA |
| Disc serial | SCUS-94608 |
| Discs | 1 |
| Supported dump | Redump `Wild Arms (USA).cue` as CUE/BIN or CHD |
| BIOS | SCPH-1001 (USA), 524288 bytes, SHA-256 `71af94d1e47a68c11e8fdb9f8368040601514a42a5a399cda48c7d3bff1e99d3` |

**BIOS:** SCPH-1001 (USA) retail BIOS, 524288 bytes, SHA-256 `71af94d1e47a68c11e8fdb9f8368040601514a42a5a399cda48c7d3bff1e99d3`. Supply your own dump; releases do not use OpenBIOS.

## Setup

1. Download the setup ZIP for your platform from [Releases](https://github.com/Alexbeav/wild-arms-recomp/releases)
   and extract it into a writable folder.
2. Start `Wild_Arms` (`.exe` on Windows).
3. In the setup wizard select your disc image (the Redump CUE, or a CHD of the
   same dump) and your BIOS file.
4. Run Generate & rebuild and wait for the game to start. The first run compiles
   the game and takes several minutes.

On Windows the wizard downloads the portable build tools (cmake-clang-v1) or uses
cmake/ninja already on PATH. On Linux and macOS install CMake, Ninja, Python 3,
and a C/C++ compiler first. Keep a CUE and every file it references together.
Setup produces both a normal and a diagnostic build; see *Diagnostic mode* below.

## Retro Launcher

You can run this title **standalone** (release zip + the built-in recomp-ui
Generate & Build flow), or manage installs, updates, ROM/BIOS wiring, and queued
builds more intuitively with
**[Retro Launcher](https://github.com/RetroPortingToolKit/Retro-Launcher)** —
the Retro Compilation Manager hub for self-compiling recomps.

Retro checks for updates, rebuilds with existing build data when possible,
shares the portable toolchain used by per-title launchers, and automates
BIOS/ROM/save plumbing so you are not stuck repeating each game’s wizard by hand.

## Status

Version 0.1.0 release candidate.

- Windows: the exact setup package passed automated clean-extract setup,
  generation, compilation, and a headless start check on the pinned framework.
- Windows play testing on the private build this kit derives from: reported Playable at the first operator tally (September 12, 2026).
- Linux and macOS: packages are built by CI from the same recipe; native setup
  and gameplay have not been verified.

Full-game completion, audio fidelity, and multiplayer are not claimed. Runtime
snapshots from older builds are not qualified compatible; ordinary memory-card
saves are preserved across updates.

## Known issues

- None recorded beyond the Status scope above.

## Diagnostic mode

If the game crashes, freezes, or misbehaves, switch to the diagnostic build
that first-run setup already produced (no recompiling): create an empty file
named `diagnostic-mode.txt` next to `Wild_Arms.exe` and start the game as
usual, or run `Wild_Arms.exe --diagnostic`. Reproduce the problem, quit, then
run `Wild_Arms.exe --collect-diagnostics`: it writes `diagnostics-<date>.zip`
next to the exe. Attach that zip to a GitHub issue on this repository with a
short description of what you did. The zip holds only the runtime's report
files, never saves, BIOS, or disc images. Delete `diagnostic-mode.txt` to go
back to normal mode. Details: `psxrecomp/docs/DIAGNOSTIC_MODE.md`.

## Legal

You must own the original game. Disc images under `disc/` are gitignored and
must never be committed. Retail BIOS dumps are not redistributed and OpenBIOS is
not shipped: this title is retail-BIOS-only, so first-run Generate needs your own
legally dumped SCPH-1001 image.

Default app icon: `assets/psxrecomp.ico` (and `.png` / `.svg`) — Retro-themed controller mark from `psxrecomp/assets/`. Windows builds embed it via `APP_ICON`.

Box art is not shipped in this kit or its repository. Redistribution permission for third-party cover images is unresolved, so the launcher runs without one.

## About this project

This project was developed with AI assistance. AI assists with code,
documentation, and investigation; Alex tests the game and makes release
decisions. Validation claims describe only the tests actually performed.
